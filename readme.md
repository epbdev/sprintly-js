# No Longer Maintained

This code is no longer being maintained, as it was determined that the usefulness was no longer needed after Sprintly's HUD updates. Current version, as hosted here, is no longer functional as Sprintly moved from Mustache to Handlebars for their templating. Repo will remain here until such a time as I deem it necessary to either update it again or just trash it altogether.

Find the bookmarklet [here](http://epbdev.github.com/sprintly-js/readme.html).

This is a bookmarklet for creating a 'My Items' page on [Sprint.ly](http://sprint.ly), so you can view all of your items across all products.

This project came about because, while I love most of Sprint.ly, I was getting annoyed at having to manually click through every product page to figure out what was and wasn't assigned to me. It got to the point that I started keeping another to-do list outside of Sprint.ly just to keep up!

This bookmarklet should help ease that frustration for anyone else who also makes use of Sprint.ly and works on multiple projects at once.

##LICENSE##
Please read the unlicense.txt file for the (un)license, or visit [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org) for more details.

##TODOS##
* Better formatting/making it pretty
* Abstract into it's own object, polluting the global namespace less
* Work it into the existing application logic more so you can interact with items, not just view them and click links

##How You Can Help##

If you would like to help make this better, please feel free to contact me or fork and send me a pull-request. Or, if you work for Sprint.ly and want to actually incorporate this into your product, please please please do so. ;)
