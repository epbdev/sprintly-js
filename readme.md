Find the bookmarklet [here](http://epbdev.github.com/sprintly-js/readme.html).

This is a bookmarklet for creating a 'My Items' page on [Sprint.ly](http://sprint.ly), so you can view all of your items across all products.

This project came about because, while I love most of Sprint.ly, I was getting annoyed at having to manually click through every product page to figure out what was and wasn't assigned to me. It got to the point that I started keeping another to-do list outside of Sprint.ly just to keep up!

This bookmarklet should help ease that frustration for anyone else who also makes use of Sprint.ly and works on multiple projects at once.

##LICENSE##

##TODOS##
* More comments so others can follow my logic better
* Better formatting/making it pretty
* HTML5 Local Storage so you don't have to put in your username and API key every time
* Work it into the existing application logic more so you can interact with items, not just view them and click links

##How You Can Help##

If you would like to help make this better, please feel free to contact me or fork and send me a pull-request. Or, if you work for Sprint.ly and want to actually incorporate this into your product, please please please do so. ;)
